# Ramsdell_CSCI2270_FinalProject
This is a test! Hello World! 

Phase 1 Requirements:
Project Summary:
For our project we will create a set of algorithms that will allow us to create different types of strategic football teams based on the player traits added into the program. For example, if we wanted a strong offensive team, the algorithm would find, compare, and arrange the best players from the set of all players. The program will take in players from a text file, but will also have the ability to add new players. When the team has been created it will assign positions to those with the correct attributes. The user will be able to change the positions of anyone on the team if they so choose. 

How to Run:
We have yet to start coding for this project, so more will be posted for this section at a later time. 

Dependencies:
Again, we have not started coding yet, so more will be posted at a later time.

System Requirements:
This project will not require the user to have any specific system requirements in order to run it. We plan to program everything in C++, which should be universally accepted amongst all computers and virtual machines. 

Group Members:
Group members for the CSCI 2270 final project will be Zachary Withrow (zachary.withrow537@gmail.com) and Blaine Ramsdell (blaine.ramsdell@colorado.edu)

Contributors:
Contributors for the CSCI 2270 final project may include, but are not limited to:
Matthew Wright (matthew.wright@colorado.edu), 
Alexander Swindell (alexander.swindell@colorado.edu), and
Brandon Knutson (brandon.knutson@colorado.edu)

Open Issues/Bugs:
No known issues, or bugs have been encountered with this project. However, we do see ourselves running into a few syntax errors and various other bugs in the code.
