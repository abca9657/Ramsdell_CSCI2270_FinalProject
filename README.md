# Ramsdell_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Phase 1 Requirements:

Project Summary:

For our project we will create a set of algorithms that will allow users to play a simple game of chess. We say a simple game of chess because our program will not include functions for some of the more intricate rules of the game. For example, our functions will be built to model the basic moves of each chess piece and will not include complex rules such as castling. The program will allow two teams to play, team one and team two. At each turn of the game, players will be asked where they would like to move. Our program will be built to check if the move is elligible, and if so allow the players to proceed with the game. As with a normal game of chess, the game will end when one team gets a checkmate. 

How to Run:

We have yet to start coding for this project, so more will be posted for this section at a later time. 

Dependencies:

Again, we have not started coding yet, so more will be posted at a later time.

System Requirements:

This project will not require the user to have any specific system requirements in order to run it. We plan to program everything in C++, which should be universally accepted amongst all computers and virtual machines. 

Group Members:

Group members for the CSCI 2270 final project will be Zachary Withrow (zachary.withrow537@gmail.com) and Blaine Ramsdell (blaine.ramsdell@colorado.edu).

Contributors:

Contributors for the CSCI 2270 final project may include, but are not limited to:
Matthew Wright (matthew.wright@colorado.edu), 
Alexander Swindell (alexander.swindell@colorado.edu), and
Brandon Knutson (brandon.knutson@colorado.edu).

Open Issues/Bugs:

No known issues, or bugs have been encountered with this project. However, we do see ourselves running into a few syntax errors and various other bugs in the code.
